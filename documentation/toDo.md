# Project To-Do List: Flask Service for Audio Analysis

## 1. Project Setup

- [ x ] **Create a new Git repository**  
  - Initialize a new repository for version control.
  - Set up `.gitignore` for Python and Flask projects.

- [ x ] **Set up a virtual environment**  
  - Install `venv` or `virtualenv`.
  - Create and activate a new virtual environment.

- [ X ] **Initialize Flask application**  
  - Install Flask (`pip install Flask`).
  - Create a basic Flask app structure (`app.py`, `templates`, `static` directories).

- [x] **Install necessary dependencies**  
  - Identify and install initial dependencies (e.g., `flask`, `flask-socketio`, `pyaudio`).

## 2. Frontend Development

- [ ] **Design the basic HTML layout**  
  - Create an HTML page (`index.html`) with a form to select microphone and headphones.
  - Add a button to start and stop audio streaming.

- [ ] **Implement audio input selection**  
  - Use JavaScript to detect available audio input devices (microphone, headphones).
  - Display a dropdown or list for the user to select devices.

- [ ] **Set up audio streaming from the browser**  
  - Implement JavaScript to capture audio using Web Audio API.
  - Use WebRTC or MediaStream Recording API to stream audio to the server.

## 3. Backend Development

- [ ] **Set up WebSocket or HTTP endpoints for audio data**  
  - Implement a WebSocket route in Flask to receive audio data in real-time.
  - Alternatively, set up an HTTP endpoint if using a different streaming method.

- [ ] **Implement audio data processing**  
  - Integrate `pyaudio` or similar library to handle incoming audio data.
  - Convert audio stream to a format suitable for transcription (e.g., WAV).

- [ ] **Integrate Speech-to-Text API**  
  - Choose a Speech-to-Text API (e.g., Google Speech-to-Text, Whisper by OpenAI).
  - Set up the API client and handle transcription requests from audio data.

## 4. AI Integration

- [ ] **Set up OpenAI API for ChatGPT**  
  - Obtain API keys and set up authentication.
  - Implement a function to send transcribed text to OpenAI's API with custom prompts.

- [ ] **Design prompt templates**  
  - Create a set of prompt templates for different types of advice (e.g., "answer the question", "simplify what you heard").

- [ ] **Implement AI response handling**  
  - Receive AI responses from OpenAI API.
  - Process and format responses for the user.

## 5. Frontend-Backend Integration

- [ ] **Display transcription and AI advice on the frontend**  
  - Update the HTML page to show live transcriptions.
  - Display the AI advice dynamically based on the responses from the backend.

- [ ] **Implement error handling and user feedback**  
  - Show appropriate error messages on the frontend if something goes wrong.
  - Provide user feedback when starting/stopping audio streaming.

## 6. Testing and Debugging

- [ ] **Test audio input and streaming functionality**  
  - Verify that audio input selection works on different browsers and devices.
  - Ensure audio streaming to the server is reliable.

- [ ] **Test transcription and AI integration**  
  - Test that transcriptions are accurate and responses are appropriate for each prompt type.

- [ ] **Implement unit and integration tests**  
  - Write tests for Flask routes, audio processing, and AI integration.
  - Use testing frameworks like `pytest`.

## 7. Deployment

- [ ] **Prepare for deployment**  
  - Set up environment variables for API keys and other configurations.
  - Choose a hosting provider (e.g., Heroku, AWS, DigitalOcean).

- [ ] **Deploy the Flask application**  
  - Deploy the app and ensure it runs correctly in the production environment.
  - Set up SSL certificates if necessary.

## 8. Documentation and User Guide

- [ ] **Write project documentation**  
  - Document setup instructions, API integrations, and any dependencies.
  - Include a user guide for using the application.

- [ ] **Create README for GitHub repository**  
  - Write a clear and concise README with an overview, setup instructions, and usage examples.

## 9. Future Enhancements

- [ ] **Plan for additional features**  
  - Consider features like multi-language support, saving conversation history, or advanced AI capabilities.
  - Prioritize and schedule these enhancements as needed.
